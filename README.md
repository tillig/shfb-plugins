# Sandcastle Help File Builder Plugins
Plugins I use in conjunction with [Sandcastle Help File Builder](https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB).

Currently there's only one plugin:

**Unique Dependency Copy**: [[Original blog article](http://www.paraesthesia.com/archive/2008/02/12/resolve-multiple-dependency-versions-in-sandcastle-help-file-builder.aspx/)] Copies assemblies using a GUID/unique name rather than the original name to allow dependency copies of multiple versions of the same assembly. (In more recent versions of SHFB you can use a binding redirect plugin instead.)
